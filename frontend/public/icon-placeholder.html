ICON PLACEHOLDER - Replace with actual app icons

You need to create two PNG icon files:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

For a quick solution, use an online tool:
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload any logo/image (or use the Package icon from the app)
3. Generate icons and download
4. Replace the placeholder icons in /frontend/public/

Or create manually:
- Use any design tool (Canva, Figma, Photoshop)
- Create a square image with your store logo
- Export as PNG at 512x512 and 192x192
- Save to this directory
